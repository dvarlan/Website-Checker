# Website Checker
 A Python script to detect and send you an email if something changed on a website
## Setup with Gmail
 For this to work you need a Google Account with 2FA (Only for the sender Account)
 
 - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords (You will have to enter your password again)
 - Generate a new Token, this will be the "password" for your sender account in the script
 - Enter the code when starting the script
 - Done

 Up until now I have only tried to use Gmail but there might be other methods.
